## 💡 Inspiration
The significance of hyper-personalization lies in its ability to create atruely one-on-one experience for customers, which is crucial in today's highly competitive market.By using advanced algorithms and the power of Large Language models(LLMs),businesses can predict what their customers want, sometimes even before they know it themselves.Hyper personalization builds stroger relationships,increases engagement , and ultimately drives higher conversion rates.

## ⚙️ What It Does
This project contains several AI models work together to create dynamic and individualized experiences.</br>

**Clustering:** KMeans helps to determine which segment a customer belongs to , allowing for more relevant and targeted product recommendations.</br>

**Multi-Target Classifcation:** The multi target classifier enables product recommendation by predicting the likelihood that the customer will be interested in various financial products.</br>

**Random Forest Regression:** Once a product is recommended ,the random forest models furthuer customize the experiences by predicting the exact loan amounts or credit limits, making the recommendation more actinable and precise.</br>

**LLM Insights:** The use of LLM ensures that the business recieves each customer  personalized summary and insights about their finacial standings , making the interaction more conversational and humman-like.
